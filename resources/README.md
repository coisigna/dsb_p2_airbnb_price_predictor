# Nomenclature

For the development of this code, as there has been two pwople involved, we have agreed to follow some rules to keep the coherence of the code in terms of variable names. We will be following this variables structure:




```python
var1 = "var_name"
varN = "var_name"

#list

l_{var1}_{varN}

#nparray

nparr_{var1}_{varN}

#dataframe

df_{var1}_{varN}

#dictionary

d_{var1}_{varN}

#series

ser_{var1}_{varN}

```

### Example

```python
ser_ticket_price = df["ticket_price"]
```
